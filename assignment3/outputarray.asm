;  Project name: "Gnu Debugger".  
;  This program demonstrates how to make an assembly program that teaches all of the following(Purpose):
;  This project develops a mixed-language program that integrates C/C++ functions with x86-64 assembly routines in order to 
;  create a workspace for GDB exploration. The program accepts an array of floating-point numbers from the user, 
;  computes their sum, sorts the values, and outputs the results.                                                          *

;  Program name: Gnu Debugger

; 
;  Project Information:
;  The primary purpose of this project is to provide a structured environment for learning and practicing the GNU Debugger (GDB). 
;  While previous assignments focused on building functional x86-64 assembly and C/C++ programs, 
;  this assignment emphasizes the debugging processâ€”setting breakpoints, stepping through code, examining registers and memory, 
;  and observing program behavior at runtime. By reusing and extending earlier functions (such as inputarray, outputarray, and sum), 
;  students can focus on mastering GDB commands and techniques in the context of a working program.
; 
; 
;  Files: outputarray.asm
;  Language: C86-64
;  Status: The program has been tested extensively with no detectable errors.

%include "data.inc"

; External functions 
extern printf
global outputarray

; segment .data is where initialized data is declared
segment .data
input db "%.1f",10,0

; segment .bss is where uninitialized data is declared
segment .bss


; segment .text is the code
segment .text

; The header or label 'deliver' defines the initial program entry point
outputarray:

; Macro backs up the GPRs
backup

; Save incoming double values
mov r13, rdi    ; r13= array for float 
mov r14, rsi    ; r14= size of array 
mov r15, 0      ; r15= counter = 0 

loop:
; Check the array is
cmp r15,r14 ; if r15 >= length of array
jge done

; load current double into the array xmm0
movsd xmm0, [r13+r15*8]
mov rdi, input
xor rax,1
call printf

inc r15
jmp loop


; Restore original values to general registers
done:
