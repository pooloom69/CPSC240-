; Project name: "Gnu Debugger".  
; This program demonstrates how to make an assembly program that teaches all of the following:
; This project develops a mixed-language program that integrates C/C++ functions with x86-64 assembly routines in order to 
; create a workspace for GDB exploration. The program accepts an array of floating-point numbers from the user, 
; computes their sum, sorts the values, and outputs the results.                                                          *

; Program information
; Program name: sum.asm
; Program languages: C86-64
; Date Program began: 09/29/2025
; Date of last update: //2025
;		 
; Purpose:
; Computes arithmetic sum of the array.
; Iterates through array values (64-bit floats).
; Accumulates total using XMM registers.
; Returns the sum to the manager and then executive.
;
; Project Information:
; The primary purpose of this project is to provide a structured environment for learning and practicing the GNU Debugger (GDB). 
; While previous assignments focused on building functional x86-64 assembly and C/C++ programs, 
; this assignment emphasizes the debugging processâ€”setting breakpoints, stepping through code, examining registers and memory, 
; and observing program behavior at runtime. By reusing and extending earlier functions (such as inputarray, outputarray, and sum), 
; students can focus on mastering GDB commands and techniques in the context of a working program.
;
;
; Files: driver.c, manager.asm, input_array.asm, output_array.asm, sum.as, swap.asm, sort.c data.inc, r.sh
; Language: C86-64
; Status: The program has been tested extensively with no detectable errors.
