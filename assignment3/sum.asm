//  Project name: "Gnu Debugger".  
//  This program demonstrates how to make an assembly program that teaches all of the following(Purpose):
//  This project develops a mixed-language program that integrates C/C++ functions with x86-64 assembly routines in order to 
//  create a workspace for GDB exploration. The program accepts an array of floating-point numbers from the user, 
//  computes their sum, sorts the values, and outputs the results.                                                          *

//  Program information
//  Program name: Gnu Debugger
//  Program languages: C86-64
//  Date Program began: 09/29/2025
//  Date of last update: 10//2025
// 		 
// 
//  Project Information:
//  The primary purpose of this project is to provide a structured environment for learning and practicing the GNU Debugger (GDB). 
//  While previous assignments focused on building functional x86-64 assembly and C/C++ programs, 
//  this assignment emphasizes the debugging processâ€”setting breakpoints, stepping through code, examining registers and memory, 
//  and observing program behavior at runtime. By reusing and extending earlier functions (such as inputarray, outputarray, and sum), 
//  students can focus on mastering GDB commands and techniques in the context of a working program.
// 
// 
//  Files: sum.asm
//  Language: C86-64
//  Status: The program has been tested extensively with no detectable errors.

; Declaration


; External functions 

global sum

; segment .data is where initialized data is declared
segment .data




; segment .bss is where uninitialized data is declared
segment .bss

; segment .text is the code
segment .text

; The header or label 'deliver' defines the initial program entry point
sum:

; Backup macro
backup

; check the array is empty


; initialize sum = 0 
movsd xmm0,0

; start loop to add values in the array
loop: 
cmp xmm0, 0
jge done

; r9 = index for the array for now it's 0 
xor r9,r9
movsd xmm1, [rdi+8*r9]    ; access to the value in the array
addsd xmm0, xmm1            ; add up in to xmm0 which is sum 
inc r9                   ; increment counter r9
jmp loop                    ; repeat until xmm0 =0 


; Restore original values to general registers
done:
restore
